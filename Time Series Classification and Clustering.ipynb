    "In a typical classification problem you are given a set of input features and a set of discrete output classes and you want to model the relationship between the two.  There is a myriad of classification algorithms that you could use for this problem - SVMs, Naive Bayes, k-NN, etc.  But what if the input features are not independent such as with time series data?  In this case SVMs and Naive Bayes would not be a good choice since they assume that the input features are independent.  The k-NN algorithm could still work however it relies on the notion of a similarity measure between input examples.  Now the question becomes _how do we measure the similarity between two time series_?"

If you are performing dynamic time warping multiple times on long time series data, this can be prohibitively expensive.  However, there are a couple of ways to speed things up.  The first is to enforce a locality constraint.  This works under the assumption that it is unlikely for $q_i$ and $c_j$ to be matched if $i$ and $j$ are too far apart.  The threshold is determined by a window size $w$.  This way, only mappings within this window are considered which speeds up the inner loop.

In this algorithm, $train$ is the training set of time series examples where the class that the time series belongs to is appended to the end of the time series.  $test$ is the test set whose corresponding classes you are trying to predict.  In this algorithm, for every time series in the test set, a search must be performed through all points in the training set so that the most similar point is found.
